I used a dataset of Orders when in this dataset there are columns like Order ID,	Order Date,	customer_id,	CustomerName,	State	City,	order_total,	Product cost,	Category
and i defined a new column called profit using the Power Bi where profit=order_total-Product cost.

After that i created a dashboard for the Orders Dataset 
>I used Line Chart for Order Date(year,month) , Profit so that i can analyze by seeing which year,month the profits got increased and decreased.
> And, I used Clustered Bar Chart for profit by category(profit,category) so that i can see in which category we can increase our production and where we need to focus to increase the sales.
>And, I used Clustered Column Chart for Profit by State(profit, state) so that i can see which state i have max sales and which states i can stop sales.
>And, I craeted a pie chart for profit and city so that i can focus in which states i can increase the production.
>And also i created a donut chart for profit and category , so that we can easily say by seeing which category the most customers bought.
>I craeted a table for the category,Revenue, profit and productcost.
>I created a slicer for the state so that if the client wants to see on the particular state by using slicer they can see.
>I craeted one more slicer for category so that client can filter by category on the dashboard.
>using card i displayed total number of orders, revenue and profit so that we can highlight this so that client can able to see the profit and revenue.
