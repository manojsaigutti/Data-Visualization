I used a dataset of Orders when in this dataset there are columns like Order ID,	Order Date,	customer_id,	CustomerName,	State	City,	order_total,	Product cost,	Category
and I defined a new column called profit using Power BI where profit=order_total-Product cost.

After that, I created a dashboard for the Orders Dataset 

I used a Line Chart for Order Date(year, month) and profit so that I could analyze by seeing which year, and month the profits got increased and decreased.
I used the Clustered Bar Chart for profit by category(profit, category) so that I could see in which category we could increase our production and where we needed to focus on increasing sales.
I used the Clustered Column Chart for Profit by State(profit, state) so that I can see which state I have max sales and which state I can stop sales.
And, I created a pie chart for profit and city so that I can focus on which states I can increase the production.
Also, I created a donut chart for profit and category so that we can easily say by seeing which category the most customers bought.
I created a table for the category, Revenue, profit, and product cost.
I created a slicer for the state so that if the client wants to see the particular state by using the slicer they can see it.
I created one more slicer for the category so that clients can filter by category on the dashboard.
using a card I displayed the total number of orders, revenue, and profit so that we could highlight this so that clients can able to see the profit and revenue.
